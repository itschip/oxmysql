# oxmysql query builder

Use the standalone `Builder` Lua API to construct parameterized SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE queries. The current implementation supports MySQL. The broader query builder specification includes proposed APIs that are not implemented yet.

## Resource setup

Add the builder import before the consuming server scripts in the resource's `fxmanifest.lua`. Declare the oxmysql dependency. Load `MySQL.lua` too when the resource uses raw SQL functions:

```lua
dependency 'oxmysql'

server_scripts {
    '@oxmysql/lib/MySQL.lua',
    '@oxmysql/lib/Builder.lua',
    'server.lua',
}
```

The two imports are independent and can appear in either order. Builder-only resources can omit `MySQL.lua`. Keep raw SQL calls under `MySQL`; use `Builder.table` and `Builder.op` for the fluent API. When migrating earlier builder examples, replace `MySQL.table` and `MySQL.op` and add the builder import.

## Supported API

- `Builder.table(name)` starts a SELECT with all columns selected by default.
- `:select({ 'id', 'name' })` selects a non-empty dense array of column identifiers. Omit this call to select all columns; `:select('*')` is unsupported.
- `:where(predicate)` adds a predicate. Repeated calls combine with AND.
- `:limit(number)` sets a non-negative safe integer limit, including zero.
- `:get(callback?)` returns a list of rows.
- `:first(callback?)` returns one row or `nil`. It caps the limit at one and preserves an explicit zero limit.
- `:insert(rowOrRows, callback?)` accepts one non-empty column/value map or a dense array of maps with identical keys. It returns the insert ID (the first generated ID for multiple rows).
- `:update(values, callback?)` accepts a non-empty column/value map and returns affected rows. It requires a predicate unless `:allowAll()` is explicitly called.
- `:allowAll()` permits an update without a predicate. A supplied predicate is still honored. It returns a new builder and is rejected by SELECT and INSERT terminals.
- `Builder.op.eq(column, value)` creates an equality predicate.
- `Builder.op.inArray(column, values)` creates an IN predicate from a dense array. An empty array matches no rows.
- `Builder.op.allOf(...)` combines one or more predicates with AND.

Use dot syntax for `Builder.table` and operator constructors, and colon syntax for chain methods. Chain methods return new builders; retain their return values. A base builder can be reused without accumulating filters or limits from derived queries.

```lua
local op = Builder.op
local base = Builder.table('users')

local staff = base
    :select({ 'id', 'name' })
    :where(op.eq('active', true))
    :where(op.inArray('role', { 'admin', 'moderator' }))
    :limit(10)
    :get()

local user = base:where(op.eq('id', userId)):first()

local insertId = base:insert({ name = 'Avery', active = true })
local changed = base:where(op.eq('id', insertId)):update({ active = false })

local matching = base:where(op.allOf(
    op.eq('active', true),
    op.eq('role', 'admin')
)):get()
```

## Execution and errors

Without a callback, `:get()`, `:first()`, `:insert()`, and `:update()` await internally and return results directly. Call them from a FiveM context that can yield, such as a thread or a suitable server handler. Do not append `.await` to builder methods.

With a callback, results are delivered to the callback:

```lua
Builder.table('users'):where(Builder.op.eq('id', userId)):first(function(user)
    if user then
        print(user.name)
    end
end)
```

Awaited execution errors reject and can be handled with `pcall`. Obvious API misuse throws locally before export dispatch. Callback execution errors are logged by default. A resource declaring `mysql_option 'return_callback_errors'` also receives execution errors as the callback's second argument, `(result, error)`. Keep that option consistent with the resource's existing error handling.

## Values and identifiers

Values must be non-null strings, booleans, or finite numbers. `false` and zero are valid. Do not pass `nil`, tables, functions, NaN, or infinity as scalar values. IN arrays must be dense and contain supported scalar values.

Table and column names are validated dot-separated identifiers, such as `users.id`; the compiler quotes each segment. Empty segments, wildcards, control characters, and `?` are rejected. Choose identifiers from application code or an allowlist. Supply user input as predicate values; never interpolate it into SQL or identifier names.

INSERT and UPDATE map keys must be unqualified column names, such as `name`; dotted keys are rejected. Mutation values follow the scalar rules above. Mutations reject `select()` and `limit()`; INSERT also rejects `where()` and `allowAll()`. Do not reuse a SELECT chain containing these clauses for a mutation.

## Unsupported queries

The current builder has no delete, ordering, offset, joins, aggregates, aliases, distinct, raw expressions, null checks, OR/NOT groups, or comparison operators beyond `eq` and `inArray`. There is no public JavaScript/TypeScript builder or PostgreSQL support.

For those operations, use the existing parameterized `MySQL` functions unless the user explicitly asks to extend the builder. For example:

```lua
local removed = MySQL.update.await(
    'DELETE FROM sessions WHERE user_id = ?',
    { userId }
)
```

## Working in the oxmysql source checkout

Treat `lib/Builder.lua` and `src/query-builder/` as the implementation authority. The [POC plan](../../docs/query-builder-poc-plan.md) describes the implemented subset; the [full specification](../../docs/query-builder-spec.md) also describes future features.

When extending the implementation, keep Lua builders and operators local to the consuming resource. Only plain query specifications cross the dedicated `queryBuilder` export. The TypeScript adapter validates specifications and uses a shared compile-only Knex MySQL client to produce SQL and bindings; execution uses the existing raw-query path. Keep Knex types out of the Lua/specification contract, and let Knex handle SQL rendering. Preserve existing `MySQL` signatures, compatibility aliases, parameter binding, invoking-resource attribution, and callback/promise error behavior.

Relevant checks are `tests/lua/query-builder.test.lua` for the Lua facade and `tests/unit/query-builder/` for compilation and execution. The POC plan documents the available validation tasks. Distinguish mocked contract checks from live FiveM/MySQL validation when reporting results.
