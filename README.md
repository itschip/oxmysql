## Lua query builder

Load the imports you need in your resource's `fxmanifest.lua`:

```lua
server_scripts {
    '@oxmysql/lib/MySQL.lua',
    '@oxmysql/lib/Builder.lua',
    'server.lua',
}
```

`Builder` provides SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE queries and predicate operators. `MySQL` provides the existing raw SQL functions. The imports work independently and can be loaded in either order.

This branch uses Kysely 0.29.8 for compile-only MySQL query generation. The Lua API
and oxmysql's existing connection pool and result handling remain the same as the
Knex branch. Kysely's dummy driver never opens a database connection.

```lua
local users = Builder.table('users')
    :select({ 'id', 'name' })
    :where(Builder.op.eq('active', true))
    :limit(10)
    :get()

local insertId = Builder.table('users'):insert({ name = 'Avery', active = true })

local affectedRows = Builder.table('users')
    :where(Builder.op.eq('id', insertId))
    :update({ active = false })

local count = MySQL.scalar.await('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users')
```

`insert(rowOrRows, callback?)` accepts a non-empty row map or a dense array of rows with identical column names. `update(values, callback?)` requires a `where` predicate; use `:allowAll():update(values)` to deliberately update every row. Without callbacks, both terminals await internally. Mutation values use the same scalar rules as predicates. Column map keys must be unqualified names. `select()` and `limit()` are unsupported on mutations; `where()` and `allowAll()` are unsupported on inserts.

Existing builder calls must change from `MySQL.table` / `MySQL.op` to `Builder.table` / `Builder.op` and load `@oxmysql/lib/Builder.lua`.

See the [query builder plan](./docs/query-builder-poc-plan.md) for the currently supported operations.

For coding agents, the [oxmysql query builder skill](./skills/oxmysql-query-builder/SKILL.md) covers imports, supported queries, execution behavior, and migration from the earlier `MySQL` builder namespace.

## 🧾 Logging

We have included a module for submitting error logs to [Fivemanage](https://refer.fivemanage.com/overextended), a cloud management service tailored for game servers. Additional logging options and support for other services will be available in the future.
